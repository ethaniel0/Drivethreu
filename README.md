# Drivethru
Drivethru is a program to automatically recognize and sort your google docs so you don't have to. It uses unsupervised learning (K-means clustering) to compare the text content of each document and group them into folders.

# How To Use
All you have to do is run the python file, given you have the required modules. To change the number of groups, change the `CATEGORIES` variable to whatever you want. The default value is 5.
